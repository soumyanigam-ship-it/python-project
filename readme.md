# Diabetes Prediction

A machine learning project to predict diabetes using patient health data.

## Project Overview
This project implements a Random Forest classifier to predict diabetes based on medical features like blood glucose levels, HbA1c, BMI, and other health indicators.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation with 95.38% accuracy

## Results
- *Accuracy*: 95.38%
- Key predictors: Blood glucose, HbA1c levels, Age, BMI

## Requirements
bash
pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn seaborn matplotlib


## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook Diabetes_prediction_(1).ipynb to preprocess data, train the model, and view results.
